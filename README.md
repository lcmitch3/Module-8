# Module 8: Advanced Data Viz in R with ggplot2

**Homework: Create quality visualizations**

For this homework assignment, you will create **two** data visualizations that adhere to the principles and guidelines presented in the video lectures and previous reading by Kelleher and Wagener (2011). You will create two plots from one of the `tidytuesday` datasets that you did not analyze as part of your first `#TidyTuesday` assignment in Module 4. Plots (1) and (2) should convey different messages - for example, if plot (1) is a line graph made with geom_line(), plot (2) should **not** be the same as (1) except an area plot made with geom_area().

Your two plots should use color wisely and include a color scale(s) that you've selected or created using a scale function. Specifically, you should use at least one of the following: (1) a brewer palette, (2) a viridis palette, (3) discrete colors selected via ColorBrewer2, or (4) discrete colors selected by choosing colors from the R Color Cheat Sheet. 

The axis and legend labels should not be the same as your column names; the labels should be edited to be "report-ready" and neat.

You will post your visualizations to a discussion forum on Moodle. In your post, include the following:
- Your two plots as PDF attachments
- A link to the GitHub repository that includes your script(s) (this may be your forked `tidytuesday` repository). Your script(s) should be in a subdirectory named `R` or `code`. Make sure the names of the script(s) make it clear which scripts were used to create the plots for this assignment.
- Rationale on the plot types you selected
- How your plot adheres to the key principles of data visualization summarized in the video lecture

*Extra credit*: Post your data visualization to Twitter. In the accompanying tweet, describe what you've plotted and include the hashtags `#TidyTuesday` and `#rstats`. Please tag me in the photo so I see your post. My username is [@NatalieGNelson](https://twitter.com/NatalieGNelson).

Assignment rubric:
- 1 points: R script(s) is organized and includes description of the selected dataset
- 8 points: visualizations were created using ggplot and follow the guidelines outlined in the assignment description
- 1 points: R script for creating your data visualization was pushed to your remote GitHub repo, and is located in a subdirectory called `R` or `code`
- 1 point extra credit: post your #TidyTuesday plots to Twitter

**Extra credit: Create an extremely ugly plot**

Using any dataset you'd like (e.g. the `tidytuesday` dataset you worked with for the homework assignment), create the ugliest plot you can come up with. The plot should be painful to look at and defy all of the key principles of data visualization. Post your plot to the discussion forum dedicated to this extra credit assignment on Moodle. For creating an ugly plot, you'll receive extra credit of 10-20% on your lowest quiz grade. Your peers will vote to determine who created the ugliest plots. The top 3 will get 20% extra on their lowest quiz grades and the others will receive 10%. Only one ugly plot submission per student is allowed.
